# XML Encoder for Go

An XML encoder for go. Heavily inspired by the json encoder that
comes with the go distribution.

## Note

I'm aware of Russ Coxs' [Statement][mail]:

> XML is for formatting documents, not for describing data
> structures.  The fact that it gets used often for the latter
> doesn't lessen its fundamental inability to do the job well.
